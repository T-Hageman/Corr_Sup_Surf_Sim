Matlab code performing the finite element simulation of an electrolyte adjacent to a corroding metal. For the electrochemical reactions, charge conservation conditions are used at the interface to couple the anodic corrosion rate to the rates of cathodic reactions. More detailed documentation is provided [here](Documentation/main.pdf).
