abstract = {<p>Computational modelling of metal-electrolyte reactions is central to the understanding and prediction of a wide range of physical phenomena, yet this is often challenging owing to the presence of numerical oscillations that arise due to dissimilar reaction rates. The ingress of hydrogen into metals is a paradigmatic example of a technologically-relevant phenomenon whose simulation is compromised by the stiffness of the reaction terms, as reaction rates vary over orders of magnitude and this significantly limits the time increment size. In this work, we present a lumped integration scheme for electro-chemical interface reactions that does not suffer from numerical oscillations. The scheme integrates the reactions in a consistent manner, while it also decouples neighbouring nodes and allows for larger time increments to be used without oscillations or convergence issues. The stability and potential of our scheme is demonstrated by simulating hydrogen ingress over a wide range of reaction rate constants and environmental conditions. While previous hydrogen uptake predictions were limited to time scales of minutes, the present lumped integration scheme enables conducting simulations over tens of years, allowing us to reach steady state conditions and quantify hydrogen ingress for time scales relevant to practical applications.</p>},

abstract = {A multi-species reactive transport model based on the sequential non-iterative approach is employed to investigate two major stages involved in artificial pit experiments of stainless steel: I. Stable dissolution under a salt film and II. Film-free dissolution that transitions to repassivation. Data of current density and electrical potential obtained from rapid polarization scans of pits with different depths are utilized to calibrate the elapsed time and the electrode kinetics of each stage. The local chemistry near the base of pits at different temperature and bulk concentrations is simulated to determine several critical electrochemical factors at saturation and repassivation.},

@article{Laycock2001,
abstract = {A model is proposed for the propagation of corrosion pits in stainless steel under potentiostatic conditions. The model is based on the requirement of a near-saturated local chemistry in the pit and uses an equation previously formulated for the anodic dissolution kinetics in this environment. Salt film precipitation, electrolytic migration, and transport outside the pit are each considered explicitly. Numerical simulations of pit growth have reproduced the experimentally observed characteristics of pitting, including development of a pit cover, spontaneous repassivation of metastable pits, increased stability at higher applied potentials, and a tendency for pits to become dish-shaped rather than hemispherical. {\textcopyright} 2001 The Electrochemical Society.

@article{Mai2016,
abstract = {This manuscript presents the formulation and implementation of a phase field model for simulating the activation- and diffusion-controlled pitting corrosion phenomena in metallic materials. Introducing an auxiliary phase field variable to represent the physical state of each material point, the free energy of the corroding metal-electrolyte system can be expressed as a function of field variables and their gradients. The governing equations for the evolution of each field variable are then derived such that the system free energy is decreased during the mass transfer and metal dissolution processes. The propagation of the diffuse interface is tracked implicitly by solving the phase field variable over the entire system, which allows the accurate approximation of complex morphological evolutions. A comprehensive study is presented to verify the accuracy of the proposed model. We show that by calibrating the interface kinetics parameter with the exchange current density, the proposed model can reproduce different portions of the polarization curve associated with the activation-controlled, diffusion-controlled, and mixed-controlled corrosion kinetics. We also demonstrate the application of this model for simulating the electropolishing process, interactions between multiple growing pits, and pitting corrosion in a metal matrix composite and a polycrystalline stainless steel.},

@article{Nguyen2022,
abstract = {This work presents a reaction-transport model for pit propagation coupled with a phase field method to model the moving boundary at the corroding surface. This enables numerical simulations of the simultaneous propagation of multiple pits in close proximity to each other to study the interactions between pits under galvanostatic conditions, with limited applied currents. Results show the formation of lacy covers over pits in stainless steel, which is due to undercutting of the surrounding surface, and reveal the development of other complex morphologies arising from the interaction between neighboring pits; e.g., the growth of “pits within pits” and the evolution of “champion pits.” Such observations are due to the shrinkage of the total active surface to sustain the limited current as pits grow larger. The proposed model can be a valuable tool for studying the evolution of pit morphology in more realistic scenarios when multiple pit initiation sites are present.},

And, the crack growth rate was impacted by crack tip pH, first decreasing, then increasing with a decrease of the seawater pH; the lowest growth rate occurred at seawater pH 4.0.

abstract = {We propose a simple, but novel mathematical and numerical approach to describe mass transport in dilute solutions, taking into consideration ionic interactions. Our proposed approach treats fluxes due to ionic interactions as additional unknowns in the transport equation. Through variational arguments, we derive a simple expression for these ionic fluxes in terms of the electroneutrality condition, which allows for a straightforward treatment of the new unknowns. Furthermore, a finite element formulation based on our mathematical model is presented. Finally, using the distribution of the interionic flux density and an energy dissipation function, we show that besides properly capturing flow due to ionic interactions, our model can also describe independent ionic flow as predicted by the conventional Nernst-Planck equation in regions where ionic interactions are weak. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},
